# Growth Mind Set
### What is a growth mindset?
### A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

### This concept struck a chord with me because I discovered that when I try things, I often get only so far before encountering a challenge and stopping. Behaving this way is all well and good when it comes to rock climbing, or judo, or kite surfing (a few of many activities I’ve failed to master), but when it comes to my work, it’s a problem.

### I think it’s my inability to use – and stay in – a growth mindset that keeps me from heading home smiling more often. So, I decided to write this to call myself out for moments of fixed-mindedness (and maybe you’ll recognize a bit of yourself in those moments, too), and share my techniques for working through them. If we can get better at catching ourselves in those moments when our brains revert to a fixed mindset, we can pull ourselves back into growth-iness and ultimately be more successful

# Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset

### Here’s an example of when I wasn’t in the right mindset: learning Java. I studied a bit of Java at university, and have worked with it in almost every role I’ve had (including my current gig as a developer on Jira Software), and yet I still find it hard to get my head around.
